# Moon Phase and Illumination Calculation

## Overview
Based on date and time input, this program calculates
* Equatorial geocentric coordinates of the moon
* Moon Phase
* Date and time for nearest next and previous quartal moon phases
* Moon Illumination Percentage

Calculations were performed using **geocentric coordinate** references and **UTC+0 time zone**.

The program implemented algorithms from 'Astronomical Algorithms' 2nd ed. by Jean Meeus (1998), and 'Practical Astronomy with your Calculator' 3rd ed. by Peter Duffett-Smith (1988).

Built using Python programming language and the TKInter module for the GUI. Moon images were sourced from the NASA Scientific Visualization Studio directory (https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a004800/a004874/frames/730x730_1x1_30p/).

## How to Install and Run
To run the code, make sure all the assets (MoonGallery folder, FaseBulan_back.py, FaseBulan_logo.ico, and FaseBulan.py) are in the same directory, then run the **FaseBulan.py**. All the calculation performed in the program is defined as functions in the **FaseBulan_back.py**.

The program can also be run as an executable file, **MoonPhase.exe**. Ensure the application is not blocked by your antivirus.
